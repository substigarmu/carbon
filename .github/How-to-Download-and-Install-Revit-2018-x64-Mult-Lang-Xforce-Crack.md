Cracking GTA San Andreas is not illegal if you have bought the game and have a valid license. It is a way of bypassing the CD check that the game performs when you start it. However, cracking the game might prevent you from playing online or accessing some features. Therefore, you should do it at your own risk and only if you have a legitimate copy of the game.
 
In this article, we will show you how to crack GTA San Andreas for PC using a simple and easy method. You will need to download a file that replaces the original executable of the game and allows you to run it without CD. This file is called a no-CD patch or crack and can be found on various websites. We will use one of the most popular and reliable sources: GameCopyWorld.
 
## Steps to Crack GTA San Andreas for PC
 
1. Go to [GameCopyWorld](https://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_gta_san_andreas.shtml) and search for GTA San Andreas.
2. Scroll down to the section "Game Fixes" and look for the version 1.01 EU No-CD patch by Deviance[^4^]. This patch works for most versions of the game, but you can also check other patches if this one doesn't work for you.
3. Click on the download link and save the file to your computer. You might need to disable your antivirus or firewall temporarily as some programs might flag this file as suspicious.
4. Extract the file using WinRAR or any other program that can handle RAR files. You should get a file called gta\_sa.exe.
5. Go to the folder where you installed GTA San Andreas on your PC. The default location is C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\GTA San Andreas.
6. Rename the original gta\_sa.exe file to something else, such as gta\_sa\_backup.exe. This way, you can restore it if something goes wrong.
7. Copy and paste the gta\_sa.exe file that you downloaded from GameCopyWorld into the same folder. Replace the existing file if prompted.
8. Run the gta\_sa.exe file as administrator and enjoy playing GTA San Andreas without CD!
